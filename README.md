Just a mini emulator for Games For Windows Live Market Place

I provide zero guarantees that I will ever finish this as this is really just one of those boredom projects where I spend about 8 hours grinding to see how far I can get.

That being said I will not be providing instructions on how to set this up or the patches I have done to make the client cooperate with redirection. Figure it out your self lol.
